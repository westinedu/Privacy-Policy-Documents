  <p>Welcome to AIGraph. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the AIGraph mobile application ("App"). By using AIGraph, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Please review them carefully.</p>

  <h2>1. Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>AIGraph offers two types of subscriptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Single Graph Subscription:</strong> Unlock access to an individual graph of your choice.</li>
    <li><strong>All Graph Bundle Subscription:</strong> Unlock access to all available graphs in the app with one subscription.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All subscriptions are valid for the duration displayed on the subscription screen at the time of purchase. Currently, all subscriptions are one year by default, but durations may change in future updates.</p>

  <h2>2. Payment and Renewal</h2>
  <p>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at the time of confirmation. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscriptions anytime in your Apple ID account settings.</p>

  <h2>3. Access and Features</h2>
  <p>Upon successful subscription, you will gain access to all applicable features and content for the graph(s) you have subscribed to. Additional content and updates may be added as part of your active subscription during the term.</p>

  <h2>4. Pricing and Changes</h2>
  <p>Prices are displayed in the app prior to purchase and may vary based on location or promotional offers. We reserve the right to update pricing and subscription plans at any time. Any such changes will apply to future purchases only.</p>

  <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>All purchases are final. We do not offer refunds for any subscriptions or in-app purchases. Users are responsible for managing their subscription choices before completing payment.</p>

  <h2>6. Updates and Modifications</h2>
  <p>We may update the app and these Terms at any time. If significant changes are made, we will notify users either through the app or by other appropriate means. Continued use of the app after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
