  <h1>AIGraph – Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Contact Email:</strong> westine@gmail.com</p>

  <p>Welcome to AIGraph. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the AIGraph mobile application ("App"), including the subscription services offered within. By using AIGraph, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

  <h2>1. Subscription Options</h2>
  <p>AIGraph offers two types of subscription services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Single Graph Subscription:</strong> Unlock access to a specific graph of your choice. Each graph can be individually subscribed to.</li>
    <li><strong>All Graph Bundle Subscription:</strong> Unlock access to <em>all</em> available graphs in the app with a single subscription.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All subscriptions are valid for the duration stated on the subscription page at the time of purchase. Currently, the subscription period is <strong>one year</strong>, but this may change in the future. Subscription automatically enables access to all included features of the graph(s) you have subscribed to.</p>

  <h2>2. Pricing and Payment</h2>
  <p>Prices for subscriptions are clearly displayed on the in-app purchase screen prior to payment. Prices may vary based on your region or promotional offers. We reserve the right to change the pricing at any time without prior notice.</p>
  <p>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at the time of confirmation. Subscriptions do <strong>not</strong> automatically renew at this time, but this policy may be updated in future versions of the App.</p>

  <h2>3. Access and Features</h2>
  <p>Once a subscription is completed successfully, you will gain full access to the selected graph(s), including all currently implemented features for those graphs. Future enhancements and additions may also be included as part of your active subscription.</p>

  <h2>4. No Refunds</h2>
  <p>All purchases are final. AIGraph does not issue refunds for subscription purchases. Users are responsible for managing their subscription choices before completing payment.</p>

  <h2>5. Modifications to the App or Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update AIGraph or these Terms at any time. If material changes are made, we will notify users either via the App or through other means. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms or your subscription, feel free to contact us at:</p>
